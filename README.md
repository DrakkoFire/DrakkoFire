## üöÄ What I Do

- **Solve real problems** end‚Äëto‚Äëend: from identifying bottlenecks to rolling out robust solutions.  
- **Ship fast & safely** using Docker, GitHub Actions, and Dokploy.  
- **Build & maintain** with Laravel & PHP on the backend; React on the frontend.  
- **Automate & optimize** everything‚Äîcode, databases, workflows, CI/CD pipelines or day‚Äëto‚Äëday processes.  
- **Tackle complexity** head‚Äëon: I‚Äôve led and shipped multiple large‚Äëscale projects, always hunting for the elegant fix.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow & Philosophy

1. **Discover** the root cause‚Äîquestion assumptions, dig into data.  
2. **Design** a lean, maintainable solution: code that‚Äôs easy to read and test.  
3. **Automate** repetitive tasks‚Äîfree up time to think.  
4. **Ship** early and often, with CI/CD guards in place.  
5. **Measure & iterate**‚Äînever settle; every process can be faster, safer, smarter.
